				Welcome to <strong>Tammy's Tantrums</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;a place where every tantrum is embraced and
				uniquely yours.
			</h1>
			<p>
				We all have a "Tammy" in our lives&nbsp;—&nbsp;that (usually calm but) wretched soul who brings out
				moments when emotions spill over, and we need to <em>let it out</em>. But here's the thing: tantrums
				don't define us; they reveal the unfiltered parts of who we are. At <strong>Tammy's Tantrums</strong>,
				we believe every tantrum tells a story, and every story deserves space to breathe.
			</p>
			<h2>How it works:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Create your own tantrum page</strong> with up to <strong>12 tantrums</strong>. Why 12? Like
					the months of the year, each tantrum marks a chapter in your story&nbsp;—&nbsp;big or small, they
					all matter.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each tantrum is represented by a <strong>distinctive coloured bubble</strong>. These bubbles
					symbolize that your tantrum is always present, bouncing around, a part of you that never fully goes
					away but doesn't need fixing.
				</li>
				<li>
					You'll receive a <strong>unique URL</strong> for your page to share with the world&nbsp;—&nbsp;which
					you can relinquish at any moment. Only <strong>you</strong> have control over your tantrum page,
					deciding what stays and what goes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Tammy's Tantrums</strong> is more than just a site&nbsp;—&nbsp;it's a celebration of life's raw,
				messy, and real moments. So go ahead&nbsp;—&nbsp;give your tantrum a bubble and let it bounce!
